# basic-node-mvc
A barebones MVC using node, handlebars and sequelize


It's so simple it literaly could have been written by anyone.

I do a lot of weekend projects. http://richardbettridge.com

I don't want to think about this stuff every time I start a new project. 

I don't want to untangle a mess every time I skip this step in favor of spiking on something.

I don't want to spend much time doing set up when I just want to try an idea out.
